# 🔄 Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard Project  

A complete customer churn analysis pipeline combining **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. This project simulates a real-world data analytics workflow—starting from ETL and cleaning in **SQL Server**, developing meaningful visuals in **Power BI**, and training a **Random Forest classifier** in **Python** to predict customer churn. The final dashboard helps businesses understand churn behavior and identify high-risk customers for timely retention strategies.
